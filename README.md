# BostonHousing
Built an optimal model based on a statistical analysis to estimate the best selling price for a clientâ€™s home.
## Purpose:
In this project I applied basic machine learning concepts on data collected for housing prices in the Boston, Massachusetts area to predict the selling price of a new home. I first explored the data to obtain important features and descriptive statistics about the dataset. Next, I properly split the data into testing and training subsets, and determined a suitable performance metric for this problem. I then analyzed performance graphs for a learning algorithm with varying parameters and training set sizes. This enabled me to pick the optimal model that best generalizes for unseen data. Finally, I tested this optimal model on a new sample and compare the predicted selling price to my statistics.
## How to use:
The project has 4 files:
* boston_housing.html: Final Report
* boston_housing.ipynb: This is the main file where my work was performed the project.
* housing.csv: The project dataset.
* visuals.py: This Python script contains helper functions that create the necessary visualizations.
